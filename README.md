# lung-disease-data-analysis
Lung cancer, one of many different types of lung diseases, is the leading cause of cancer
death worldwide, accounting for 1.59 million deaths in 2018. The majority of lung cancer cases
are attributed to smoking, but exposure to air pollution and age is also a considered risk factor.
For this data analysis, the primary goal was to find the correlation (if any) between air pollution and
level of lung disease, age and level of lung disease, and exactly how different levels of smoking affected
the level of chronic lung disease in men and in women.
